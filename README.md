# AgriVeritas â€“ MRV System for Paddy & Agroforestry

## Overview
AgriVeritas is a scalable, cost-effective **Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system** designed for smallholder-driven agriculture.  
It leverages **drone-based remote sensing, AI/ML models, and GIS tools** to monitor **paddy fields and agroforestry systems**.  

By detecting **tree count, type, canopy coverage, and crop health** from aerial imagery, the system generates accurate estimates of **carbon stock and sequestration**.  
This empowers **farmers, policymakers, and verifiers** to track sustainability, improve land use decisions, and unlock opportunities in **carbon credits and climate finance**.

## Technology Stack
- **Remote Sensing & Drones** â€“ High-resolution drone imagery and multispectral data for farmland and agroforestry monitoring.  
- **GIS & Geospatial Processing** â€“ ArcGIS, QGIS, Rasterio, GeoPandas, and GeoServer for spatial analysis, mapping, and visualization.  
- **AI/ML & Computer Vision** â€“ Vision-Language Models (VLMs), YOLO for object detection, SAMGeo for segmentation, and zero-shot classification for crop/tree detection.  
- **Height & Biomass Estimation** â€“ DEMs and CHMs to estimate tree height and biomass.  
- **Mobile Application** â€“ Kotlin-based Android app for field-level data collection, ground-truthing, and farmer access.  
- **Data Management & APIs** â€“ PostgreSQL/PostGIS for spatial data storage with REST APIs.  
- **Visualization & Dashboard** â€“ Web GIS dashboard for carbon stock tracking, paddy monitoring, and agroforestry insights.

## Prototype Description
The prototype integrates **processed raster and shapefile data** into two interfaces:  
- **Android app** â€“ Primary field tool for farmers and surveyors with farm- and village-level insights, plus ground-truth data collection.  
- **Web dashboard** â€“ Centralized platform for stakeholders to visualize geospatial layers such as tree count, crop type, canopy height, and land cover.  

Together, these enable **transparent and verifiable monitoring** of paddy and agroforestry systems, supporting **carbon stock estimation, yield assessment, and MRV reporting**.  
The solution is designed to be **low-cost, accessible, and scalable across diverse agro-climatic zones**.
